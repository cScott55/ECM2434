        <p class="lead"; color:Limegreen;>Hello!</p>
        <p>Welcome to Green Beans! This a group developed web app with the goal of promoting sustainability and eco friendly</p>
        <p>practises at the University Of Exeter. As part of the app, users will get their very own Green Bean Pet, which</p>
        <p>they can feed by completing challenges. These challenges range from walking to recycling, all which allow users</p>
        <p>to gain points and climb the leaderboard. See if you and your Green Bean can reach the top!</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="lead">Our Goals</p>
        <p>Our goal is to help promote sustainable practises on the University of Exeter campus. The university aims by 2030</p>
        <p>to have a carbon net zero impact, and we all can easily help achieve this in our everyday lives. We wish to show</p>
        <p>how a few small changes can have a big impact on the environment, whether it be walking instead of driving or </p>
        <p>using a recyling bin instead of a regular one. We also want to encourage users to explore the University campus</p>
        <p>with location based challenges that help show off some natural beauty. The best part is you get to do it alongside</p>
        <p>a cute little green bean pet!</p>
