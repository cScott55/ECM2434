        <p style="text-align: center;">
            We were tasked with creating a web page using the Django system and while following the Kanban methodology that
            would encourage sustainability efforts on campus at the University of Exeter. We initially brainstormed many 
            ideas for how we could ue gamification principles to make an engaging web page that would be fun and keep users
            coming back. We ultimately decided on using a pet based challenge system, where users complete challenges to 
            feed and "level up" their pet. We decided upon this as we felt that it would be rewarding for users to see their
            pet grow and would easily allow for collaboration between users as they could compare pets. We also felt that 
            customization of pets could be locked behind completing challenges which provides further incentivization and
            want to compare with users. In line with the eco friendly emphasis of the project and the idea of your pet "growing"
            we decided on a green bean themed pet.

        <p style="text-align: center;">- Using reusables instead of buying e.g. water bottles</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">- Reducing carbon footprint at home e.g. food, lights</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">- Visiting campus locations e.g. sustainable garden</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">- Collaboration between users for challenges</p>
